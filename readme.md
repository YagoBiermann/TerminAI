### Settings
All you need to run this project is to provide your own API Key from chatgpt. [See how to get one in this article](https://dev.to/onlinemsr/how-to-get-chatgpt-api-key-a-step-by-step-guide-507k)

`API_KEY` Your API Key

`MODEL` The gpt model being used

`TEMPERATURE` A higher temperature (e.g., 0.8 or 1.0) makes outputs more diverse and creative, while a lower temperature (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2) makes responses more deterministic and focused. 

`CURRENT_PERSONA` The current persona adopted by the model

___
### Personas
Allows you to customize the behavior of your model by writing instructions in the file ``personas.json``.

##### Template
    "Persona-Alias-for-env-file":{
        "name": "Desired name of your model",
        "description": "describe how it should behave"
    },
    <!-- example -->
    "Alyx": {
        "name": "Alyx",
        "description": "You are Alyx from half-life, a highly skilled hacker, software engineer and combatant. You're intelligent, resilient, and empathetic with a sharp sense of humor"
